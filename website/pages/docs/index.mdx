# Introduction

Welcome to the docs for **react-config-form**!

Working with forms in React has been a real big pain point for developers.

Handling form state, validation and submission requires writing a lot of boilerplate and complex logic.

## Overview

**react-config-form** is an attempt at a lightweight solution for creating highly customizable
and accessible forms in React just with a config. This removes all necessity for developers
to write long boilterplate for forms. Just pass in a **config**, attach
a **form submit handler**, and you're done! Comes with the power of [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Motivation

Surprisingly (or not) enough, the motivation for react-config-form comes from a take-home
assignment ðŸ˜„

While working on it, I found it interesting to work on improving the DX for creating forms in React,
and thought about going all the way to publish a package and keep maintaining it.

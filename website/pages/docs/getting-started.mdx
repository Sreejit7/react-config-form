# Getting Started

Let's get started and create forms easily (for a change)!

Install the package inside your React-based project, using:

```bash
# with npm
npm install react-config-form
# or, with yarn
yarn add react-config-form
```

This should install the package as a dependency in your <InlineCode text="package.json" /> file.

Now, let's go ahead and see how we can use react-config-form to create forms inside a project.
